# What is this?
This is a compilation of Python projects. I've used Python a bit in the past but looking at some of these, it appears I am a bit rusty...

# Projects
In order it was added

## Web Scraper Test
Scrapers were some of the most frequent tools I made with Python in the past so I figured it was a good starting point for this collection. It just grabs some quotes and prints them to the terminal.

## Prefix Suffix
I was reading through some the latest additions to Python and saw it had these prefix and suffix trim functions. Just checking it out.

## Weather
Not much to this, just grabs a response from wttr.in and prints it to the screen. All the heavy lifting is of course done from their site.

## RPG
I am obsessive with RPGs so naturally I wanted to make a simple one. This is a pretty bad one to be honest, but it was fun learning to parse through inputs without just blindly accepting whatever came through.

## Number Guess
Taking it a bit further with the previous project, I wanted to play with input as well as cleaning up the terminal as the game progressed.
